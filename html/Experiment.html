			<h2>1. Analysis and Experimental Methods</h2>
			<h3>1-1. Structural analysis method using CanDo</h3>
			<p> CanDo (Computer-Aided Engineering for DNA Origami) is a method for predicting the three-dimensional shape of DNA origami, including its bends and twists, from its design. Each base pair of the double helix is treated as a finite element, and the average position coordinates and RMSF (RMSF) for each base pair are calculated. Position coordinates and RMSF (Root-Mean-Square Fluctuation) values for each base pair. The following six states of triangular DNA origami were subject to structural analysis to verify the correlation between the shape of triangular DNA origami and the dimer formation rate.</p>
			<p>(State 1) Only one of the three sides contains a linker.</p>
			<p>(State 2) Containing linkers on only two of the four linkers on any one of the three sides, either the inner or outer two.</p>
			<p>State 1 is the analysis to verify the correlation between the state of the triangular DNA origami at the time of dimer formation and the dimer formation rate. This was done for the first and second design origami. State 2 is the analysis of the correlation between the dimer formation experiment of the second design origami by selective linker (which will be described in Section 4) and the dimer formation rate.</p>
			<h3>1-2. Methods for the preparation of triangular DNA origami</h3>
			<div class="container">
				<p>The method for the preparation of triangular DNA origami is described. After mixing the solutions according to Table 1, a thermal cycler (Program Temp Control System PC-350, ASTEC) was used to anneal it at a constant rate (-1°C/min) from 90°C to 20°C for 70 min. After annealing, the solution was stored at 4°C.</p>

			<h3>1-3. Dimer preparation method</h3>
			<p>This section describes the dimer preparation method for triangular DNA origami. The method of dimer production of triangular DNA oligomers is described. Four linkers corresponding to each side were mixed in equal quantities, then diluted further 100-fold with ultrapure water to prepare a linker solution for each side. The linker solution corresponding to the side to be bound was added to the triangular DNA origami solution (concentration of M13mp18): (concentration of each linker) = 1:4. The solution was then annealed in a thermal cycler from 60°C to 20°C at a constant rate (-0.02°C/min) for 2000 min. After annealing, the solution was stored at 4°C.</p>
			<h3>1-4. Methods for dimer formation by selective linker</h3>
			<p>In order to verify the contribution of edge deformation and linker binding position to the dimer formation rate, the dimer formation was carried out by two linkers out of four on each side. Two of the four linkers were selected, as shown in Fig. 3. The red and blue linkers are used for the outer side, and the green and black linkers are used for the inner side. The mixing and annealing were the same as for the case with four linkers.</p>
			<h3>1-5.  Evaluation of dimer formation</h3>
			<p>Triangular DNA origami and its dimer formation were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation. The AFM procedure is described below.</p>
			<p>(1) Mix 10 X TAE buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl buffer, 0.4 M acetic acid, and 0.01 M EDTA) and MgCl₂ solution to concentration</p>s of 1X and 25 mM, respectively.
			<p>(2) Drop 30 µL of the solution of step (1) onto the cleaved mica, followed by 10 µL of the sample solution, and wait for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>(3) Remove the solution from the mica using a micropipette and wash the sample with ultra-pure water. The sample is washed by dropping 30 µL of ultrapure water onto the micropipette, waiting for 10 seconds, and then removing the solution.</p>
			<p>Repeat this three times.</p>
			<p>(4) Dry the sample for 2 minutes using an N₂ gun.</p>
			<p>(5) Observe the sample with an AFM (MultiMode 8, BRUKER).</p>
			<p>The BRUKER is equipped with a cantilever (Tap300AI-G, Budget Sensors) with a resonance frequency of 300 kHz. The dimer formation rate (unit: %) was calculated according to formula (1) below.</p>

			<h2>2. Results and Correlation</h2>
			<h3>2-1. Correlation between analysis results and dimer formation rate</h3>
			<p>The correlation between the results of the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimer formation rate is described below.The correlation between the results of the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimer formation rate is described below. The graphs in Figures 2 to 5 (a) to (c) show the outermost double helix (hereafter referred to as the outermost helix) of the triangular DNA origami.The horizontal axis indicated the 336 base pairs belonging to the double helix, and the vertical axis indicated the two-dimensional distance in the graph. The 2D distance was calculated using only the coordinates parallel to the plane containing the triangular DNA origami, which were the average position coordinates of the base pairs outputted by CanDo.The distance between the base pairs at the two ends of the outermost helix and the average positional coordinates of the base pairs. The deformation toward the inside of the triangular DNA origami is negative (concave), while the deformation toward the outside is positive (concave) (Fig 1).</p>

				<p>Below are the analytical results and the dimer formation rate.(State 1) For the first designed origami, the outermost helix of the B edge was convex (Fig 2(b)).The outermost helix was concave when the linker on side A or C was included (Fig 2(a), (c)). For the second origami design, the outermost helix of the A or B edge was convex when the linker of the A or B edge was included (Fig 2(a), (c)). On the other hand, the outermost helix of the C edge was concave in the state containing the C edge linker (Figure 3(c)).Comparing this analysis with the dimer formation rates (Fig 2(d) and 3(d)), the dimer formation rate at the edge where the outermost helix is convex with the linker is higher than that at the edge where the outermost helix is convex with the linker.</p>

				<p>(State 2) In the state containing the Outside linker on any one of the three edges, the outermost helix was convex as for the A and B edges, and the helix was concave as for the C edge (Fig 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)). Based on the correlation between the unevenness of the outermost helix and the dimer formation rateAs described in State 1, it was predicted that the dimer formation rate by the Outside linker would be higher on the A or B edge and lower on the C edge. The experimental results were in agreement with this prediction (Fig 4(d)). The double helix was convex between the Outside linker positions on side A or B, while the Inside linker position is concave on all sides (Fig 5 (a), (b)).On the other hand, edge C was almost straight (Fig 5 (c)). In the dimer formation experiment, the dimer formation rate was relatively high for the A and B edges and low for the C edge (Fig 5 (d)). From these results, it can be inferred that the dominant factor in dimer formation is not the concave shape of the outermost helix as a whole but rather the partial shape of the linker at the position where the linker of the inside joins. The dimer formation rate was higher for the partially convex A and B edges and lower for the partially non-convex C edge on the linear chain.</p>

				<div class="p_dayo">
				<p>The following is what can be inferred from the results of dimer formation experiments on the Outside and Inside. In contrast to the usual method, in which eight linkers of four different linkers are used to combine the triangular DNA folds, this experimental method uses four linkers of two different linkers. The dimer formation rate was lower than when four species were used, but the rate was higher when Inside linkers were used compared with Outside linkers, as shown in Figures 4(d) and 5(d). In other words, the linker at the inside position was more dominant than the dimer formation rate. If the outermost helix is convex, the binding of Outside and Inside would be shown in the upper graph of Fig 7, and this tendency was also confirmed in the AFM images (Fig 6) for each binding method on the A side. Therefore, the convex shape of the outermost helix is thought to facilitate bonding in the Inside linker. The proximity of the bonding positions of the two Inside linkers might also be a factor that facilitates bonding even with a convex shape. Therefore, as in the B edge of the first design origami and the A and B edges of the second design origami, if the convex shape of the outermost helix could be maintained on all sides of the triangular DNA origami, the dimer formation rate would be improved.Another factor is the length of the linker. The linkers are all 22 bases long, as shown in Figure 3, and the linker length between the three double helix is (9 bases + 6 bases) + 7 bases. This 7-base portion is only 2.4 nm, so it is affected by even the slightest in the situation shown in Fig 7 Outside in the upper row or in the lower row, where the outermost helix has a concave shape.</p>

				<h2>3. Verification of Assumptions</h2>
				<h3>3-1. Triangle DNA origami redesign considering deformation </h3>
				<p>Based on the above results and correlations, we assumed that the shape of the outermost helix was the dominant factor in dimer formation and redesigned the second DNA design origami, considering deformation. This is referred to as the redesigned origami. In this redesign, we aimed to satisfy the following three conditions:</p>
				<p>(Condition 1) The 7-base side of the linker should be longer.</p>
				<p>(Condition 2) The origami should be flat when all sides of the linker are included, and the outermost helix should be convex and closer to a straight line.</p>
				<p>(Condition 3) When only one of the three sides contains a linker and the outermost helix on that side is convex and closer to a straight line.</p>
				<p>The following is a description of the two main changes from the second design origami.</p>
				<p>(Change I) The 7-base side of all 12 linkers is extended from 7 to 13 bases. The length of the adjacent staple was shortened by 6 bases.</p>
				<p>(Change II) The staple of the second double helix from the outside of each of the three trapezoids was shortened by one base per trapezoid.</p>
				<p>The reason for the design of Change I is that by lengthening the linker, the presence of a slight irregularity in the outermost helix can be minimized. Change II is a new design method introduced this time, which is designed to make the outermost helix convex and the shape of the linker bonding position closer to a straight line. It is possible to modify only the staple and linker in the relevant section.The design can be modified by changing only the staple or linker in the relevant section.A more detailed explanation of Modification Point II is provided below. In the triangular DNA origami used in this study, the distance between the crossovers is mainly 31 bp (base pair) or 32 bp. In the new design, the distance was intentionally shortened by 1 base pair (bp) or 2 bp to induce deformation in the two adjacent double helixes that were combined by a crossover<sup class="reference"><a href="#Reference_1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.  This design prevents significant deformation of the linker binding position. The crossover, which shortens the spacing, should be as close as possible to the top of the triangle to avoid significant deformation of the linker bonding position by this design. Fig 8 shows the results of the CanDo structural analysis of the redesigned origami with linkers on only one of the three sides and deformation of the corners. Although the corners are significantly deformed due to the special design, conditions 2 and 3 were achieved.During this redesign, four other staples were changed to correct areas that were different from the design intent in the second design origami.However, this did not significantly affect the rate of dimer formation. </p>

				<h3>3-2. Dimer formation experiment using redesigned origami</h3>
				<p>A redesigned origami was created and used to conduct an experimental study on dimerization at edge C. The dimer formation rate was 41.9%, showing an improvement compared to the dimerization results at edge C using the second origami design. In this design, the formation rate of the monomer of the triangular DNA origami decreased. The formation rate was 65.8%, lower than the 85.7% of the modified second-design origami. This decrease was contributed to the three factors. Reducing the stiffness of the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami by extending the linker from 7 bases to 13 bases. Folding edges within a single DNA origami. The shortened staples in the modified design did not efficiently form a double helix to induce deformation. </p>

					<div class="p_dayo">
						<p>Considering the significant impact of spacer-introduced linkers on dimer formation revealed by CanDo analysis, a linker with a thymine T spacer inserted with 6 bases was designed to bridge triangular DNA origamis at the center, as shown in Fig 9. The dimer formation experiment using this modified second-design origami with the spacer-inserted linker is shown in Fig 10. Compared to the results of dimer formation using the linker without a spacer in the second design origami, there was an improvement in dimer formation rate at side C. While similar dimer formation rates were observed at sides A and B, it is inferred that inducing a spacer does not affect the linker length when the outermost helix is convex like sides A and B, but it has a significant effect when the outermost helix is concave like side C. Therefore, lengthening the linker is believed to significantly improve the dimer formation rate at side C. It is considered that the main factor contributing to the improved dimer formation rate at side C in the redesigned origami is the elongation of the linker.Furthermore, an observed increase in the dimer formation rate was accompanied by gaps formed between the triangular DNA origamis. These gaps may not be suitable for high-precision two-dimensional arrays, yet they verified the assumption that the shape of the outermost helix is the dominant factor in dimer formation.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To investigate the dominant factors affecting dimer formation rate in the assembly of dimer formation experiments by combining triangular DNA origami with linkers, structural analysis using CanDo and dimerization experiments under various conditions were conducted in this study. A comparison between the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimerization experiment results revealed the following two points:</p>
				<p>(1) When a linker was added to only one side of the three sides, if the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami had a convex shape on the plane containing the origami, the dimer formation rate on that side tended to be higher. Conversely, if it had a concave shape, the dimer formation rate was lower.</p>
				<p>(2) Comparing the shapes of the outermost helix when linkers were added to the inner two crossover points connecting triangular DNA origamis versus when added to the outer two points, the former showed a convex center shape in the outermost helix, resulting in a higher dimer formation rate in the dimerization experiment.</p>
				<p>Based on these analytical results, it was suggested that designing the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami so that it has a convex shape when a linker is added to only one side of the three sides could suppress the decrease in dimer formation rate. Consequently, modified triangular DNA origamis were designed with this insight. Additionally, considering the significant impact of the outermost helix shape on dimer formation rate according to CanDo analysis, linkers inserting six bases as spacers were designed for the central part bridging triangular DNA origamis. Dimerization experiments utilizing these designs demonstrated the validity of the hypothesis that the shape of the outermost helix is a dominant factor in dimer formation rate.</p>
