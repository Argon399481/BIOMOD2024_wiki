			<h2>Optimization and confirmation of DNA origami assembling</h2>
			Firstly, we optimized the annealing condition (in terms of annealing speed, salt
			concentr
			ation) of DNA origami nanostructures. As annealing condition candidate, -1°C / min (#1-1
			), -6°C / hour (#2-1), and -1°C / hour (#3-1) was adopted.
			<br>
			As MgCl2 concentration candidates, 0, 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mM were chosen. Figure 1 shows
			th
			e result of agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA origami nanostructures annealed in
			various ann
			ealing conditions.
			<figure>
					<img src="AGE-1-2.png">
					<figcaption>Fig. 1 Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA nanostructures

							ith various annealing conditions and salt concentrations.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			Compared to the band of scaffold (M13), bands of the samples annealed in the protocol
			#2-1 with 1
			5mM MgCl2 and #3-1 with 12.5 and15mM moved more downwards in the gel, suggesting some
			structure wa
			s formed in these conditions.
			As generally longer annealing time is required for 3D DNA origami nanostructures, it was
			as we expected that the structural bands d
			id not appear in the samples annealed in #1-1 protocol.
			<br>
			<br>
			Next, we evaluated the samples annealed by #2-1 and #3-1 protocols with higher MgCl2
			concentration (Figure 2). The bands of the sample assembled in the higher MgCl2
			concentration kept the same place as 15 mM MgCl2, suggesting that 12.5 mM or 15 mM MgCl2
			is required for proper assembly.
			<figure>

			</figure>
			Since our project goal is to fold DNA origami nanostructures in liposomes, potential
			damage to liposomes such as high temperature is better to be avoided. For this reason,
			modified annealing conditions without a hot process of 85°C were investigated. The
			modified annealing process is defined as protocol #2-2 and #3-2, respectively. Figure 3
			shows the electrophoresis result of the DNA origami assembled by #2-1, #2-2, #3-1, or
			#3-2 protocols.
			<figure>
					<img src="AGE-3-2.png">
					<figcaption>Fig. 3 Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA nanostructures
							annealed by #2-1, #2-2, #3-1, or #3-2 protocols.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			The certain formation of the DNA origami nanostructures was evaluated by AFM
			observation. Rectangular shapes were observed in both samples annealed by #2-2 and #3-2,
			supporting the successful formation of the designed DNA origami nanostructures.
			<figure>
					<img src="AFM_observation.png">
					<figcaption>Fig. 4 Representative AFM observation images of the DNA origami
							nanostructures. The MgCl2 concentration was 15 mM in both annealing conditions.
					</figcaption>
			</figure>
			As a result of these experiments, the optimal annealing condition in the liposomes was
			set to be #2-2 and the optimal salt concentration was determined as 15mM. The DNA
			origami assembly in the liposomes described above was carried out by this protocol.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2> Formation of DNA origami inside liposome</h2>
			<h3>1. Preparing heat resistant liposome</h3>
			In order to fold DNA origami structure in liposomes, preparing heat resistant liposomes
			that can retain the structure during the annealing process was required. To achieve
			this, we prepared liposomes with the certain composition of several lipids and compared
			them in terms of forming rate and heat resistance at 60℃ to investigate the optimal
			lipid composition of heat-resistant liposomes. Anionic lipid POPG, as well as
			cholesterol and POPC was used to prepare heat-resistant liposomes. According to the
			research, adding POPG is effective for creating stable GVs at high temperatures. figure
			5 and 6 shows liposomes with different lipid composition after the annealing process
			observed
			with confocal laser scanning microscopy. While liposomes made only with cholesterol and
			POPC were aggregated after the annealing process, liposomes with POPG were not. This
			result suggests that POPG is effective in preparing heat resistant liposomes.
			<figure>

					<figcaption>Fig. 6 Liposomes without POPG observed by confocal microscopy

			</figure>
			<h3>2. Folding DNA origami nanostructures in heat resistant liposomes </h3>
			By using heat-resistant liposomes, the DNA origami assembly in the liposomes was carried
			out. M13 scaffold and staple DNA strands were added to the inner solution of liposomes,
			and the DNA-containing liposome solution was annealed the same as DNA origami assembly
			in a PCR tube. After the annealing process, the liposome membrane was destructed by
			vortex process and the samples were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis.
			<br>
			<br>
			First, we investigated whether the DNA origami in the liposome can be observed in the
			agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7). As a positive control, the liposome solution
			including pre-annealed DNA origami was prepared and observed with the membrane
			destruction. Moreover, TritonTMX-100 (TX-100) was used for certain membrane destruction.
			<figure>
					<img src="AGE-lipo1-1.png">
					<figcaption>Fig. 7 The agarose electrophoresis analysis of the liposome solution
							destructed by various conditions. “Annealing in Lipo” means the DNA origami was
							annealed in the liposome. “Annealing in Bulk” means the DNA origami was annealed
							in bulk solution, then included inside the liposome. The two images are obtained
							from the same gel at different exposure times.
					</figcaption>
			</figure>
			The bands are observed in the liposome solution samples. Even in the liposome solution
			sample without vortex process, the band was observed. It may be because the addition of
			a loading buffer or voltage application might have destructed liposome membranes.
			However, neither of the bands of the liposome samples containing DNA origami annealed in
			a solution nor in the liposome did not match the bands of DNA origami annealed in bulk.
			<br>
			<br>
			We considered that the fragments of liposome membranes, addition of KCl or remaining
			TX-100 may have affected the observed result of electrophoresis. To avoid these factors,
			a purification process using centrifugal filters (Amicon Ultra) was performed. Fig. 8
			shows the electrophoresis result of the samples with the purification process.
			<figure>
					<img src="AGE-lipo2-1.png">
					<figcaption>Fig. 8 The agarose electrophoresis analysis of the DNA origami collected
							from various conditions. In the caption of the annealing column, “None” means
							that the liposome contained M13 and staple strands but was not annealed. “Pre”
							means the DNA origami was annealed in bulk solution, then included inside the
							liposome. “In lipo” means the DNA origami was annealed in the liposome.
					</figcaption>
			</figure>
			The Amicon filters successfully removed the excess DNA strands. In the KCl added
			samples, the bands moved slightly to the top. It might be because the total charge of
			the DNA nanostructure has changed by the addition of monovalent cation. It was also
			suggested that Triton-X 100 doesn’t affect the electrophoresis bands.
			<br>
			<br>
			As an important point, the band place of the pre-annealed DNA origami nanostructures
			collected from the liposome (lane of “Pre”) matched with the nanostructures assembled in
			the bulk solution. From this point, the band of DNA origami assembled in the liposome is
			expected to appear in the same position when the origami is folded as designed.
			However, the band of the DNA origami annealed in the liposome did not appear to the same
			place of the band of the origami annealed in a bulk solution. Rather, it matched with
			the one with just a mixture of scaffold and staple strands that was not annealed.
			<br>
			<br>
			As the final experiments in this BIOMOD term, we changed some experiment conditions as
			follows and tried the assembly of DNA origami again;
			<br>
			<br>
			(i) Anneal the inner solution to investigate the effect of sucrose on DNA origami
			folding.<br>
			(ii) Increase staple ratio to enhance the possibility of correct DNA origami assembly.<br>
			(iii) Reduce the scaffold and staple concentration to avoid a risk of “overcrowded”
			situation in liposomes that might affect the folding.<br>
			(iv) Add twice amount lipids in liposome preparation to increase the reaction field for
			DNA origami folding.
			<figure>
					<img src="AGE-lipo3-1.png">
					<figcaption>
							Fig. 9 The agarose electrophoresis analysis of the DNA origami annealed in
							various conditions. In the caption of the annealing column, “in bulk” means the
							DNA origami was annealed in bulk solution, while “In lipo” means the DNA origami
							was annealed in the liposome. When the DNA origami was annealed with sucrose,
							the concentration was 300 mM. The two images are obtained from the same gel at
							different exposure times.

					</figcaption>
			</figure>
			The band place of DNA origami annealed with 300 mM sucrose did not match the band of DNA
			origami annealed in normal bulk solution. Rather, the band place is the same as the
			sample of the mixture of scaffold and staple that was not annealed. The position of the
			bands did not change under conditions where sucrose was removed by purification. These
			results suggest that DNA origami is not folded as designed under the condition with
			sucrose.
			<br>
			<br>
			Further investigation and experimentation will be required to fold DNA origami in
			liposomes, such as investigating the effect of sucrose on folding and preparing
			liposomes by the hydration method.

			<h3>Design and assembly of DNA origami nanostructures</h3>
			DNA origami nanostructures are designed and simulated by using cadnano software and
			canDo simulator, respectively. The raw json data and sequence list is available from
			this link. Before the structural formation, the concentration of each staple DNA strand
			was measured by using Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The formation of the
			DNA nanostructures was carried out by mixing 10 nM of scaffold DNA (m13mp18 ssDNA) with
			50 nM of staple strands in the folding buffer containing 1x TAE (40 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA
			(pH 8.3)) and various concentrations of MgCl2 (and 100 mM KCl, if described). The
			mixture was annealed by one of the annealing conditions as follows:
			<br>
			<br>
			#1-1: Heated to 85°C for 20 sec, then cooled from 60°C to 25 °C by -1°C / min<br>
			#2-1: Heated to 85°C for 20 sec, then cooled from 60°C to 25 °C by -6°C / hour (-0.1°C /
			min)<br>
			#3-1: Heated to 85°C for 20 sec, then cooled from 60°C to 25 °C by -1°C / hour (-0.1°C /
			6 min)<br>
			#2-2: Heated to 60°C, then cooled from 60°C to 25 °C by -6°C / hour (-0.1°C / min)<br>
			#3-2: Heated to 60°C, then cooled from 60°C to 25 °C by -1°C / hour(-0.1°C / 6min)<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			After annealing, the samples were stored in a temperature-controlled room at 25 °C.
			<h3>Agarose gel electrophoresis</h3>
			The 1% agarose gel was prepared by dissolving an agarose tablet (Cat. No: AG13, Nippon
			Gene, Tokyo, Japan) by running buffer. The electrophoresis running buffer contained x0.5
			TBE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM borate and 5 mM EDTA) and 5 mM MgCl2. The electrophoresis sample
			was prepared by mixing a loading buffer (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan, Cat. No: 9156).
			Electrophoresis was performed at 50 V for 90 min in a temperature-controlled room at
			25 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold for 5 min and washed
			with ultrapure water for 3 min. Images were obtained using a gel imager (LuminoGraph I,
			ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).
			<h3>AFM observation
			</h3>AFM observation was carried out on the freshly cleaved mica surface under dry
			conditions. To fix the DNA origami nanostructures on the mica surface, 5 µL of DNA
			origami solution was dropped onto the mica, followed by the addition of 10 µL of folding
			buffer (1xTAE, 15 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 5 min. After incubation, the mica surfaces
			were rinsed with a total volume of 150 µL ultrapure water and finally well-dried by
			gentle air blowing. AFM measurement was performed using Multimode 8 (Bruker, MA, USA)
			with SCANASYST-AIR probe (Bruker).

			<h3>Preparation of the liposome (giant unilamellar vesicle)
			</h3>A lipid mixture in chloroform was prepared by mixing POPC, POPG and cholesterol in
			the described components. A lipid firm was prepared on a glass tube by evaporating a 30
			μL lipid mixture solution in a nitrogen gas atmosphere and then left to stand for at
			least one night. Afterwards, an aliquot of mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No:
			330760-1L (heavy)) was mixed with the lipid film mentioned above, and the lipid was
			dissolved in mineral oil by sonication for 60 min at 50 °C. Then, 20 μL of the liposome
			internal buffer LI (1x TAE, 15 mM MgCl2, 300 mM glucose, (and 100 mM KCl, if described))
			was added to the mixture and vortexed for 1 min to prepare W/O emulsion. The emulsion
			was added upon 300 μL of the liposome external buffer LO (1x TAE, 15 mM MgCl2, 300 mM
			glucose (and 100 mM KCl, if described)) kept in a tube and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for
			10 min. The precipitated liposomes were carefully collected by inserting the pipet chip
			from top of the tube. The liposomes were observed and evaluated by using a confocal
			microscope (Nikon AX, Nikon solutions, Tokyo, Japan)
			<h3>Assembly of DNA origami inside the liposome
			</h3>A lipid mixture was prepared by POPC, POPG and cholesterol at a molecular ratio of
			3:1:6 and a lipid firm was prepared by the same method described above. To assemble DNA
			origami nanostructures inside liposomes, 10 nM of M13 scaffold, 50 nM of staple strands,
			and 100 mM KCl was added to the buffer LI, while 100 mM KCl was added to the buffer LO.
			The liposome containing scaffolds and staples is prepared by the same method as the
			previous section. A total of 50 μL liposome solution was dispensed into a PCR tube, then
			the sample was annealed with the protocol of #2-2 described above.

			<h3>Liposome destruction and structural evaluation
			</h3>Before the electrophoresis, the annealed liposome was destructed by the vortex
			operation for each 3 min. ​​For more certain disruption of liposome membranes, some
			samples were vortexed with TritonTMX-100 (TX-100). When TX-100 was mixed to the liposome
			solution, a total of 5 μL of TX-100 solution (containing 40 mM TX-100, 1x TAE, 15 mM
			MgCl2) was mixed to the 25 μL liposome solution before the vortex operation. The final
			TX-100 concentration was ≈ 6.7 mM. The membrane destructed liposome solution was applied
			with loading buffer and electrophoresis was performed as same methods described above.
			<h3>Filter purification
			</h3>A part of samples including DNA origami nanostructure and destructed liposome was
			purified with a 100 kDa MWCO (molecular weight cut-off) centrifuge filter (Amicon Ultra,
			Merck Millipore) to remove excess staple strands and lipid membrane fragments. First, 20
			μL DNA origami solution or 30 μL liposome solution was injected to the filter unit with
			a total of 450 μL purification buffer (1x TAE, 10 mM MgCl2). The filter units were
			centrifuged at 10000 x g for 5 min. After discarding the solution on the lower side of
			the filter unit, a total of 450 µL of buffer was added to the filter unit and
			centrifuged again. The filtered solution was collected by reversing the filter and
			centrifugation at 1000 x g for 2 min. After purification, the MgCl2 concentration was
			immediately recovered by adding a buffer (1xTAE, 200 mM MgCl2)

			<h3>Streptolysin O (SLO) pore formation assay
			</h3>A total of 3μL liposome solutions containing 10 nM scaffold (M13mp18) attached with
			AMCA-modified DNA strands (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), 2μL of outer buffer
			containing 1 μM FAM-modified DNA strand, 2μL of SLO diluted in outer solution and 3 μL
			outer solution of liposomes were gently mixed in a PCR tube. The final SLO concentration
			was 0.1 mg / mL. After mixing each solution, the sample was incubated for >1 hour to
			form pores on the lipid membrane of liposomes. Pore formation was evaluated by observing
			the fluorescence of each DNA strand by a confocal microscopy.

		<h2 id="BGB">BGB structure</h2>
		<p>As described in the design section, BGB structures are expected to enhance the robustness of liposomes. To advance applications for future drug development, we established an experimental system that encompasses the fabrication of a three-layer structure, as well as purification and stability evaluation of the products. In the first half of this section, we introduce and evaluate the products obtained during the preparatory stage for BGB structure formation. In the second half, we validate the formation of the structure and evaluate its stability.Additionally, we report the successful recovery of this structure with a collection rate of over 90%.</p>
		
		
		<h3>〇3重層構造体の形成のための準備物</h3>
		<h4>- Preparation and evaluation of the DNA hydrogel</h4>
		<p>→このセクションは横尾君にお願いしてます。</p>
		<h4>- 正電荷リポソームの開発と、相互作用の確認</h4>
		<p>The designed three-layer structure is formed by the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and DNA. To induce the interaction, liposomes containing a 30 mol% ratio of DOTAP, a positively charged phospholipid, were prepared. To confirm the electrostatic interaction, FAM-modified single-stranded DNA strands added to the inner solution of liposomes were observed using a confocal microscope. Rhodamine PE (Rhod-PE) was mixed at a concentration of x%, and FAM-DNA (濃度) was encapsulated to observe the lipid membranes and DNA, respectively.  FAM-DNA was observed at the same position as the membrane, while FAM molecules added as control were not.  This indicates the interaction between liposomes and DNA contributed to binding both molecules. （Fig..a,b,）   In contrast, DNA-FAM was observed to spread evenly throughout the inner fluid in membranes without DOTAP. （Fig..c） These results prove the contribution of DOTAP in attaching DNA due to the electrostatic interaction.</p>
		
		
		<figcaption>Fig.
		(a)DOTAP : POPC= 7 : 3, FAM-DNA
		(b)DOTAP : POPC= 7 : 3, FAM
		(c)POPConly, FAM-DNA</figcaption>
		
		
		<h4>- BG structureの作成と、構造の凝集を抑えるためのゲルコーティング</h4>
		<p>As the next step in obtaining BGB structures, BG structures—a complex composed of liposomes and DNA—need to be prepared. To form the desired three-layer structure, we must consider two phenomena: uneven gel formation on liposomes and aggregation between liposomes due to the sticky ends of DNA hydrogels. Uneven accumulation of the gel can cause irregularities on the membrane surface, interfering with electrostatic interactions. Moreover, liposomes can get trapped by hybridization of sticky ends between gels. The 'gel-coating method' was developed to address these issues during the preparation of BG structures. The detailed procedure is described in the design section. </p>
		<p>To observe the localization of DNA, AMCA-DNA was added at 100nM in DNA hydrogel.</p>
		<p>After the annealing process for even gel formation on liposomes, AMCA-DNA was observed aligning neatly along the membrane, indicating reduced aggregation of DNA hydrogel on liposomes. In addition, after applying the gel-coating process with the one-sticky-end Y motif structure, a reduction in liposome aggregation was confirmed (Fig. c).</p>
		
		<div class="container">
			<p>The rates of liposomes with even formed DNA hydrogel were 85% and 87.5% in annealed samples or gel coated samples(N=2)(Fig..d). Compared with the percentage in not annealed BG solution, 6.9%, the annealing process reduced aggregation of DNA hydrogel-bind liposomes approximately twenteen times.</p>
			<p>The percentage of not-aggregated liposomes in after gel-coated process samples,75%, shows highest rates of three, suggesting the efficiency for preventing aggregation of liposomes. However, in the not annealing samples, the percentage of not aggregated liposomes is 51.7%, while the annealed samples remained 15%. This result indicates that the concentration of liposomes causes the aggregation. Needing detailed verification, the same concentration of each sample must be prepared, though we did not conduct this for focusing on evaluation of stability of BGB structure rather than the effects of methods.</p>

		<h4>- New centrifugal sedimentation for the effective encapsulation of outer membrane</h4>
		<p>For the efficient encapsulation of the BG structures with the outer membrane, a concentration of 100 mol% DOTAP was used to the inner leaflet of 2nd membrane of BGB to enhance the electrostatic interaction between the lipids for the formation of micelles and  DNA hydrogel of BG. Moreover, to prevent electrostatic interactions between obtained structures due to the positive charge of DOTAP, cholesterol and DOPC were added at a 4:3 mol% ratio for the outer leaflet of 2nd membrane of BGB. After the centrifugating operation, an xx% yield of BGB structures was detected by confocal microscopy. Compared with the yield of BGB structures obtained by conventional centrifugal sedimentation (yy%), an approximately x-fold increase in purification efficiency was confirmed(Fig..b). Detailed characterization and validation of these structures are discussed in the following paragraph.</p>

		<h3>〇構造体形成の証明と膜上でのゲルの形成確認</h3>
		<h4>- 3重層の証明</h4>
		<p>To confirm and visualize the formation of the designed three-layer structure, NBD-PE, AMCA-DNA, and Rhod-PE, were applied to the inner membrane, gel layer, and outer membrane, respectively. Confocal microscopy observation revealed that the overlapping of three types of fluorescence in the same circles.. The fluorescence signals of AMCA and NBD-PE were weak, requiring stronger laser power and careful observation to observe the inner layers. To obtain more conclusive data, 1 µM calcein was added to the inner solution. This sample showed green fluorescence inside the membrane with the gel layer and outer membrane fluorescence.These results suggest the formation of the three-layer structure. (Fig. a).</p>
		
		
		<h4>- ゲル形成の証明</h4>
		<p>To evaluate whether the DNA hydrogel is certainly formed between the two membrane layers, we conducted FRAP experiment.  If the DNA hydrogel is formed, the fluidity of the DNA hydrogel layer is expected to be lower than lipid membrane layers. The detailed methods are described in the materials and methods section. Fluorescence recovery was observed in all layers of BDB structures (Fig. b, c).</p>
		<p>The liquidity of DNA layers is as expected because they do not form the networks, just binding on membranes by electrostatic interactions. In contrast, fluorescence recovery on BGB layers was observed only in two of the membranes, but not in the gel layer. The lower fluidity in the gel layer strongly supports the formation of the DNA hydrogel between the two membranes and successful construction of BGB structures.</p>

		<h2>2. Results and Correlation</h2>

		<p>The correlation between the results of the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimer formation rate is described below.The correlation between the results of the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimer formation rate is described below. The graphs in Figures 2 to 5 (a) to (c) show the outermost double helix (hereafter referred to as the outermost helix) of the triangular DNA origami.The horizontal axis indicated the 336 base pairs belonging to the double helix, and the vertical axis indicated the two-dimensional distance in the graph. The 2D distance was calculated using only the coordinates parallel to the plane containing the triangular DNA origami, which were the average position coordinates of the base pairs outputted by CanDo.The distance between the base pairs at the two ends of the outermost helix and the average positional coordinates of the base pairs. The deformation toward the inside of the triangular DNA origami is negative (concave), while the deformation toward the outside is positive (concave) (Fig 1).</p>

			<p>Below are the analytical results and the dimer formation rate.(State 1) For the first designed origami, the outermost helix of the B edge was convex (Fig 2(b)).The outermost helix was concave when the linker on side A or C was included (Fig 2(a), (c)). For the second origami design, the outermost helix of the A or B edge was convex when the linker of the A or B edge was included (Fig 2(a), (c)). On the other hand, the outermost helix of the C edge was concave in the state containing the C edge linker (Fig 3(c)).Comparing this analysis with the dimer formation rates (Fig 2(d) and 3(d)), the dimer formation rate at the edge where the outermost helix is convex with the linker is higher than that at the edge where the outermost helix is convex with the linker.</p>

			<p>(State 2) In the state containing the Outside linker on any one of the three edges, the outermost helix was convex as for the A and B edges, and the helix was concave as for the C edge (Fig 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)). Based on the correlation between the unevenness of the outermost helix and the dimer formation rateAs described in State 1, it was predicted that the dimer formation rate by the Outside linker would be higher on the A or B edge and lower on the C edge. The experimental results were in agreement with this prediction (Fig 4(d)). The double helix was convex between the Outside linker positions on side A or B, while the Inside linker position is concave on all sides (Fig 5 (a), (b)).On the other hand, edge C was almost straight (Fig 5 (c)). In the dimer formation experiment, the dimer formation rate was relatively high for the A and B edges and low for the C edge (Fig 5 (d)). From these results, it can be inferred that the dominant factor in dimer formation is not the concave shape of the outermost helix as a whole but rather the partial shape of the linker at the position where the linker of the inside joins. The dimer formation rate was higher for the partially convex A and B edges and lower for the partially non-convex C edge on the linear chain.</p>

			<p>The following is what can be inferred from the results of dimer formation experiments on the Outside and Inside. In contrast to the usual method, in which eight linkers of four different linkers are used to combine the triangular DNA folds, this experimental method uses four linkers of two different linkers. The dimer formation rate was lower than when four species were used, but the rate was higher when Inside linkers were used compared with Outside linkers, as shown in Figures 4(d) and 5(d). In other words, the linker at the inside position was more dominant than the dimer formation rate. If the outermost helix is convex, the binding of Outside and Inside would be shown in the upper graph of Fig 7, and this tendency was also confirmed in the AFM images (Fig 6) for each binding method on the A side. Therefore, the convex shape of the outermost helix is thought to facilitate bonding in the Inside linker. The proximity of the bonding positions of the two Inside linkers might also be a factor that facilitates bonding even with a convex shape. Therefore, as in the B edge of the first design origami and the A and B edges of the second design origami, if the convex shape of the outermost helix could be maintained on all sides of the triangular DNA origami, the dimer formation rate would be improved.Another factor is the length of the linker. The linkers are all 22 bases long, as shown in Figure 3, and the linker length between the three double helix is (9 bases + 6 bases) + 7 bases. This 7-base portion is only 2.4 nm, so it is affected by even the slightest in the situation shown in Fig 7 Outside in the upper row or in the lower row, where the outermost helix has a concave shape.</p>

			<h2>3. Verification of Assumptions</h2>
			<h3>3-1. Triangle DNA origami redesign considering deformation </h3>
			<p>Based on the above results and correlations, we assumed that the shape of the outermost helix was the dominant factor in dimer formation and redesigned the second DNA design origami, considering deformation. This is referred to as the redesigned origami. In this redesign, we aimed to satisfy the following 3 conditions:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
				<li><span class="emphasize">Condition 1</span> <br> The 7-base side of the linker should be longer.</li>
				<li><span class="emphasize">Condition 2</span> <br> The origami should be flat when all sides of the linker are included, and the outermost helix should be convex and closer to a straight line.</li>
				<li><span class="emphasize">Condition 3</span> <br> When only one of the three sides contains a linker and the outermost helix on that side is convex and closer to a straight line.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;">The following is a description of the two main changes from the second design origami.</p>
			<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
					<li><span class="emphasize">Change I</span> <br> The 7-base side of all 12 linkers is extended from 7 to 13 bases. The length of the adjacent staple was shortened by 6 bases.</li>
					<li><span class="emphasize">Change II</span> <br> The staple of the second double helix from the outside of each of the three trapezoids was shortened by one base per trapezoid.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;">The reason for the design of Change I is that by lengthening the linker, the presence of a slight irregularity in the outermost helix can be minimized. Change II is a new design method introduced this time, which is designed to make the outermost helix convex and the shape of the linker bonding position closer to a straight line. It is possible to modify only the staple and linker in the relevant section.The design can be modified by changing only the staple or linker in the relevant section.A more detailed explanation of Modification Point II is provided below. In the triangular DNA origami used in this study, the distance between the crossovers is mainly 31 bp (base pair) or 32 bp. In the new design, the distance was intentionally shortened by 1 base pair (bp) or 2 bp to induce deformation in the two adjacent double helixes that were combined by a crossover<sup class="reference"><a href="#Reference_1" title="H. Dietz, S. M. Douglas, and W. M. Shih : “Folding DNA into Twisted and Curved Nanoscale Shapes”, Science, Vol.325, No.5941, pp.725-730 (2009)">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.  This design prevents significant deformation of the linker binding position. The crossover, which shortens the spacing, should be as close as possible to the top of the triangle to avoid significant deformation of the linker bonding position by this design. Fig 8 shows the results of the CanDo structural analysis of the redesigned origami with linkers on only one of the three sides and deformation of the corners. Although the corners are significantly deformed due to the special design, conditions 2 and 3 were achieved.During this redesign, four other staples were changed to correct areas that were different from the design intent in the second design origami.However, this did not significantly affect the rate of dimer formation. </p>

			<h3>3-2. Dimer formation experiment using redesigned origami</h3>
			<p>A redesigned origami was created and used to conduct an experimental study on dimerization at edge C. The dimer formation rate was 41.9%, showing an improvement compared to the dimerization results at edge C using the second origami design. In this design, the formation rate of the monomer of the triangular DNA origami decreased. The formation rate was 65.8%, lower than the 85.7% of the modified second-design origami. This decrease was contributed to the three factors. Reducing the stiffness of the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami by extending the linker from 7 bases to 13 bases. Folding edges within a single DNA origami. The shortened staples in the modified design did not efficiently form a double helix to induce deformation. </p>

					<p>Considering the significant impact of spacer-introduced linkers on dimer formation revealed by CanDo analysis, a linker with a thymine T spacer inserted with 6 bases was designed to bridge triangular DNA origamis at the center, as shown in Fig 9. The dimer formation experiment using this modified second-design origami with the spacer-inserted linker is shown in Fig 10. Compared to the results of dimer formation using the linker without a spacer in the second design origami, there was an improvement in dimer formation rate at side C. While similar dimer formation rates were observed at sides A and B, it is inferred that inducing a spacer does not affect the linker length when the outermost helix is convex like sides A and B, but it has a significant effect when the outermost helix is concave like side C. Therefore, lengthening the linker is believed to significantly improve the dimer formation rate at side C. It is considered that the main factor contributing to the improved dimer formation rate at side C in the redesigned origami is the elongation of the linker.Furthermore, an observed increase in the dimer formation rate was accompanied by gaps formed between the triangular DNA origamis. These gaps may not be suitable for high-precision two-dimensional arrays, yet they verified the assumption that the shape of the outermost helix is the dominant factor in dimer formation.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>To investigate the dominant factors affecting dimer formation rate in the assembly of dimer formation experiments by combining triangular DNA origami with linkers, structural analysis using CanDo and dimerization experiments under various conditions were conducted in this study. A comparison between the structural analysis by CanDo and the dimerization experiment results revealed the following two points:</p>
			<ol style="margin: 10px 0;">
				<li>When a linker was added to only one side of the three sides, if the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami had a convex shape on the plane containing the origami, the dimer formation rate on that side tended to be higher. Conversely, if it had a concave shape, the dimer formation rate was lower.</li>
				<li>Comparing the shapes of the outermost helix when linkers were added to the inner two crossover points connecting triangular DNA origamis versus when added to the outer two points, the former showed a convex center shape in the outermost helix, resulting in a higher dimer formation rate in the dimerization experiment.</li>
			</ol>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Based on these analytical results, it was suggested that designing the outermost helix of the triangular DNA origami so that it has a convex shape when a linker is added to only one side of the three sides could suppress the decrease in dimer formation rate. Consequently, modified triangular DNA origamis were designed with this insight. Additionally, considering the significant impact of the outermost helix shape on dimer formation rate according to CanDo analysis, linkers inserting six bases as spacers were designed for the central part bridging triangular DNA origamis. Dimerization experiments utilizing these designs demonstrated the validity of the hypothesis that the shape of the outermost helix is a dominant factor in dimer formation rate.</p>
