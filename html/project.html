        <h2>Project</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>DNA spontaneously forms double helix structures based on base complementarity under appropriate temperature and ionic conditions. In recent years, a technology called DNA origami has attracted attention, which uses this property to fold long cyclic single-stranded DNA (scaffold) with hundreds of short single-stranded DNA (staple) to produce two-dimensional or three-dimensional nanoscale structures with a size of approximately 100 nm (1) (2). By combining multiple DNA origami and making them into polymers, it is possible to fabricate larger-scale structures with complex functionality (3)(4). In this study, we focus on two-dimensional arrays in which multiple two-dimensional structures are combined from among the multimeric forms of DNA origami obtained in this way. Two-dimensional arrays using DNA origami can be used for various applications. For example, using the property that nanostructures can be modified on DNA, a sample with a high-density array of proteins called ion channels on the surface of a two-dimensional array can be prepared, and if ion channel dynamics can be observed by applying X-ray single-molecule measurement methods (5)(6), statistical evaluation under the same conditions will be possible. In the same way, gold nanoparticle dimers for SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) (7) can be precisely and densely arrayed. Furthermore, they can be used as masks for nanolithography (8)-(11). However, the size of 2D arrays of DNA origami is currently limited to a few µm square, and the existence of partial defects and deformations precludes their use in applications where geometric precision is required. To ensure the mechanical rigidity of a two-dimensional array structure, a method called “crossover” using single-stranded DNA to crosslink the double helix structures of two DNA origamis is particularly suited for precise, gapless joining. The single-stranded DNA used for this purpose is called a linker. However, this method has not yet produced two-dimensional arrays of sufficient size and yield, which is a problem to be solved. In this study, a system in which equilateral triangular DNA origami (hereafter referred to as triangular DNA origami) are joined by a linker to form two-dimensional arrays was targeted. The triangular DNA origami was designed to be suitable for two-dimensional arrays, with each side measuring approximately 114 mm (Fig. 1).
